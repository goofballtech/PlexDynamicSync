# PlexDynamicSync
Currently in it's alpha form. Do not attempt to put into use yet. 

Loosly based on what @FMstrat presented [here](https://github.com/Fmstrat/plex-db-sync/issues/21) before he went MIA. Since most of my knowledge is in node and my deployments are currently in docker i will start there with implementation.
